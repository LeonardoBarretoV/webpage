abstract: This paper studies official sovereign debt empirically and theoretically. We document that official sovereign debt is more than half of the total sovereign debt in emerging markets, and tends to rise during default episodes and downturns, much more than debt with private creditors. We develop a sovereign default model with official and private debt. A fraction of the defaulted debt accumulates during default episodes, which resolve when the sovereign pays back its accrued obligations. Official debt is longer term than private debt and contains a collateral value that depends on the country’s resources. Our model is able to rationalize the fact that official debt is sizable and is used more heavily during default episodes and downturns.
