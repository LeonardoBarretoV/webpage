abstract: This paper studies official sovereign debt empirically and theoretically. Official sovereign debt is more than half of the total sovereign debt in emerging markets and tends to rise during default episodes, much more than debt with private creditors. We develop a model with official and private debt where the sovereign can partially default on each of its debts. A fraction of the defaulted debt accumulates during a default episode, which resolves when the sovereign pays back its accrued obligations. We find that official debt is longer-term than private debt and more concessional. These differences across debts allow our model to rationalize the stylized facts of emerging markets. Counterfactual analysis suggests that official debt is welfare improving for indebted economies and finds the possibility of voluntary swaps of private for official debt during debt crises.
