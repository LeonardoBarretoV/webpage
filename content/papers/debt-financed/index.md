abstract: This paper studies the welfare consequences of the debt-financed fiscal stimulus implemented in the United States during the 2020 recession. I develop an open economy heterogeneous-agent model calibrated to the U.S. and compute a transition between a pre-stimulus stationary equilibrium and a new equilibrium with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio resulting from the fiscal response to the recession. The transition path incorporates the observed evolution of government policies from 2020 to 2024. The model reproduces the dynamics in U.S. households' self-reported well-being through a novel empirical validation exercise that mimics households’ survey responses, and rationalizes why well-being remained depressed during 2023 and 2024 despite low levels of unemployment and inflation — a puzzling fact for the literature. Behind this result, low- and middle-income households spend the stimulus transfers and gradually decumulate assets, while high-income households absorb these assets. The government policy generates lifetime welfare gains concentrated at the bottom of the wealth distribution, while households at the top experience small losses. Stimulus checks and the revaluation of assets are the key drivers of these results. In the counterfactual exercises, I find scope for further increases in debt and better-designed tax policies that increase welfare.

summary: This paper studies the welfare consequences of the debt-financed fiscal stimulus implemented in the United States during the 2020 recession. I develop an open economy heterogeneous-agent model calibrated to the U.S. and compute a transition between a pre-stimulus stationary equilibrium and a new equilibrium with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio resulting from the fiscal response to the recession. The transition path incorporates the observed evolution of government policies from 2020 to 2024. The model reproduces the dynamics in U.S. households' self-reported well-being through a novel empirical validation exercise that mimics households’ survey responses, and rationalizes why well-being remained depressed during 2023 and 2024 despite low levels of unemployment and inflation — a puzzling fact for the literature. Behind this result, low- and middle-income households spend the stimulus transfers and gradually decumulate assets, while high-income households absorb these assets. The government policy generates lifetime welfare gains concentrated at the bottom of the wealth distribution, while households at the top experience small losses. Stimulus checks and the revaluation of assets are the key drivers of these results. In the counterfactual exercises, I find scope for further increases in debt and better-designed tax policies that increase welfare.
