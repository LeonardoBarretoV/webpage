  This paper studies the welfare consequences of the debt-financed fiscal stimulus implemented in the United States during the 2020 recession. I develop an open-economy heterogeneous-agent model calibrated to the U.S. and compute a transition between a pre-stimulus stationary equilibrium and a new equilibrium with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio resulting from the fiscal response to the recession. The transition path incorporates the observed evolution of government policies from 2020 to 2024. The model reproduces the dynamics of U.S. households' self-reported well-being through a novel empirical validation exercise that mimics their survey responses and rationalizes a puzzling fact in the literature: household well-being remained depressed during 2023 and 2024 despite low levels of unemployment and inflation. The mechanism behind this result is a gradual reallocation of assets: low- and middle-income households spend their stimulus transfers early in the transition and subsequently decumulate savings, while high-income households absorb these assets and expand their wealth holdings, leaving the average household worse off through 2023-2024. The government policy generates lifetime welfare gains concentrated at the bottom of the wealth distribution, while those at the top experience small losses. Stimulus checks and the revaluation of assets are the key drivers of these results. In the counterfactual exercises, I find scope for further increases in debt and better-designed tax policies that increase welfare.

  This paper studies the welfare consequences of the debt-financed fiscal stimulus implemented in the United States during the 2020 recession. I develop an open-economy heterogeneous-agent model calibrated to the U.S. and compute a transition between a pre-stimulus stationary equilibrium and a new equilibrium with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio resulting from the fiscal response to the recession. The transition path incorporates the observed evolution of government policies from 2020 to 2024. The model reproduces the dynamics of U.S. households' self-reported well-being through a novel empirical validation exercise that mimics their survey responses and rationalizes a puzzling fact in the literature: household well-being remained depressed during 2023 and 2024 despite low levels of unemployment and inflation. The mechanism behind this result is a gradual reallocation of assets: low- and middle-income households spend their stimulus transfers early in the transition and subsequently decumulate savings, while high-income households absorb these assets and expand their wealth holdings, leaving the average household worse off through 2023-2024. The government policy generates lifetime welfare gains concentrated at the bottom of the wealth distribution, while those at the top experience small losses. Stimulus checks and the revaluation of assets are the key drivers of these results. In the counterfactual exercises, I find scope for further increases in debt and better-designed tax policies that increase welfare.
