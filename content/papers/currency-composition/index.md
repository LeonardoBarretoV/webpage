abstract: This paper examines the interaction between the currency denomination of sovereign debt and the composition of its holders. We document that, in emerging economies, local-currency bonds constitute the main instrument of government debt and are predominantly held by domestic investors. We develop a framework that characterizes the trade-offs governments face when domestic and foreign demand for bonds respond differently to policy changes. Domestic investors prefer local-currency bonds because these assets provide insurance against distortionary taxation. The government internalizes how currency denomination influences domestic demand and default risk, generating a novel endogenous link between the composition of bondholders and the choice of currency. Even abstracting from the standard hedging benefits against output fluctuations, it remains optimal for the government to issue local-currency debt to stimulate domestic demand, consistent with empirical evidence. Finally, we show that imposing minimum domestic holdings of foreign-currency bonds through financial repression can implement the optimal allocation without relying on local-currency issuance.

summary: This paper examines the interaction between the currency denomination of sovereign debt and the composition of its holders. We document that, in emerging economies, local-currency bonds constitute the main instrument of government debt and are predominantly held by domestic investors. We develop a framework that characterizes the trade-offs governments face when domestic and foreign demand for bonds respond differently to policy changes. Domestic investors prefer local-currency bonds because these assets provide insurance against distortionary taxation. The government internalizes how currency denomination influences domestic demand and default risk, generating a novel endogenous link between the composition of bondholders and the choice of currency. Even abstracting from the standard hedging benefits against output fluctuations, it remains optimal for the government to issue local-currency debt to stimulate domestic demand, consistent with empirical evidence. Finally, we show that imposing minimum domestic holdings of foreign-currency bonds through financial repression can implement the optimal allocation without relying on local-currency issuance.
