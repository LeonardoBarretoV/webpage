abstract: This paper explores the macroeconomic implications of tight global financial conditions in a small open economy New Keynesian model with sovereign default. My analysis shows that the interplay between the government incentives to repay the debt and inflation during periods of high world interest rates has distinct implications for monetary policy. I show that a monetary easing may emerge when a world interest rate hike induces a substantial increase in the probability of default, depressing domestic demand and leading firms to reduce inflation. This default amplification channel complements the expenditure-switching and expenditure-reducing channels found in standard open economy models, and rationalizes why emerging economies might reduce monetary policy rates when the Federal Reserve tightens. An increase in sovereign risk reduces aggregate domestic demand beyond these conventional channels, leading a real exchange rate depreciation to be contractionary for output.
